    <td>Colored interacting particle systems on the ring: Stationary measures from Yang&ndash;Baxter equation</td>
    <td><p>Recently, there has been much progress in understanding stationary
     measures for colored (also called multi-species or multi-type) interacting
     particle systems, motivated by asymptotic phenomena and rich underlying
     algebraic and combinatorial structures (such as nonsymmetric Macdonald
     polynomials).</p>

    <p>In this work, we present a unified approach to constructing stationary
     measures for several colored particle systems on the ring and the line,
     including (1)~the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (mASEP); (2)~the
     \(q\)-deformed Totally Asymmetric Zero Range Process (TAZRP) also known
     as the \(q\)-Boson particle system; (3)~the \(q\)-deformed Pushing Totally
     Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (\(q\)-PushTASEP). Our method is based
     on integrable stochastic vertex models and the Yang&ndash;Baxter equation.
     We express the stationary measures as partition functions of new "queue
     vertex models" on the cylinder. The stationarity property is a direct
     consequence of the Yang--Baxter equation. This is joint work with
     A. Aggarwal and L. Petrov.</o>

    <td>Oscillator representations of quantum affine orthosymplectic superalgebras</td>
    <td>We introduce a category of \(q\)-oscillator representations over the quantum
         affine superalgebras of type D and construct a new family of its irreducible
         representations. Motivated by the theory of super duality, we show that
         these irreducible representations naturally interpolate the irreducible
         \(q\)-oscillator representations of affine type \(X\) and the finite-dimensional
         irreducible representations of affine type \(Y\) for \((X,Y) = (C,D), (D,C)\)
         under exact monoidal functors. This can be viewed as a quantum (untwisted)
         affine analogue of the correspondence between irreducible oscillator and
         irreducible finite-dimensional representations of classical Lie algebras
         arising from the Howe’s reductive dual pairs \((g,G)\), where
         \(g = sp_{2n}, so_{2n}\) and \(G = O_l, Sp_{2l}\). This talk is based
         on a joint work with Jae-Hoon Kwon and Masato Okado

    <td>Polyhedral realizations and extended Young diagrams of several classical affine types</td>
    <td>The crystal bases are powerful tools for studying the representation
      theory of quantized enveloping algebras. By realizing crystal bases as
      combinatorial objects, one can reveal skeleton structures of representations.
      Nakashima and Zelevinsky invented 'polyhedral realizations', which are
      realizations of crystal bases \(B(\infty)\) and \(B(\lambda)\) as integer
      points in some polyhedral convex cones or polytopes. It is a natural
      problem to find an explicit form of inequalities that define the
      polyhedral convex cones and polytopes. To construct the polyhedral
      realization, we need to fix an infinite sequence \(\iota\) of indices.
      In this talk, we will give an explicit form of inequalities in terms
      of extended Young diagrams in the case the associated Lie algebra is
      classical affine type of \(A^{(1)}_{n-1}\), \(D^{(2)}_n\) and \(\iota\)
      satisfies a condition called adapted. We will also provide a
      combinatorial description of inequalities in the
      \(C^{(1)}_{n-1}\), \(A^{(2)}_{2n-2}\)-cases.

    <td>New solutions to the tetrahedron equation associated with quantized six-vertex models</td>
    <td><p>Tetrahedron equation is a key to integrability for 3-dimensional lattice models,
         as the Yang&ndash;Baxter equation is for 2-dimension. Compared with the
         Yang&ndash;Baxter equation, the tetrahedron equation is much less studied.
         On the other hand, there are some interesting connections of the 3-dimensional
         integrability with the representation theory of quantized coordinate rings,
         reductions to the 2-dimensional cases, and so on.</p>

         <p>In our recent paper (A. Kuniba, S. M. and A. Yoneyama,
             <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10258">arXiv:2208.10258</a>),
             we considered the tetrahedron equation of the
             form \(RLLL=LLLR\), which is called a quantized Yang&ndash;Baxter equation.
             The \(L\) operators here are built from \(q\)-Weyl algebra and can be
             regarded as quantized six-vertex models. The solutions \(R\) are obtained
             explicitly in many cases, whose elements are factorized or expressed
             with a terminating \(q\)-hepergeometric series.</p>

         <p>This talk will include an introduction to 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional
             integrable lattice models, in addition to the results.</p>

    <td>Explicit solutions of the Yang&ndash;Baxter equation via skew Howe duality and \(F\)-matrices</td>
    <td>We construct matrix solutions to the Yang&ndash;Baxter Equation (YBE) associated
         to the spinor object in the fusion ring \(O(2n)_2\) in two ways. Let
         \(S = S_+ \oplus S_-\) denote the spinor module for \(U_q(\mathfrak{o}_{2n})\) and by
         slight abuse of notation its image in the fusion quotient \(O(2n)_2\).
         On one hand, first we define commuting actions of \(U_q(\mathfrak{o}_{2n})
         = U_q(\mathfrak{so}_{2n}) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2\) and the non-standard
         deformation \(U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_m)\) on the exterior algebra
         \(\bigwedge(\mathbb{C}^{nm}) \cong S^{\otimes m}\) and obtain a multiplicity-free
         decomposition. Then we construct solutions of the YBE as certain polynomials
         in the generators of \(U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_m)\). Our construction factors the
         \(U_q(\mathfrak{o}_{2n}) \otimes U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_m)\)-action through
         the quantum Clifford algebra \(Cl_q(nm)\) and carries over to the fusion
         quotient. In addition, the general linear quantum group \(U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)\)
         is a subalgebra of \(U_q(\mathfrak{so}_{2n})\) and \(U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_m)\)
         is a co-ideal subalgebra of \(U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_m)\), so our construction
         fits in a see-saw extending a \(U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)\otimes U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_m)\)
         skew duality result. On the other hand, we construct solutions of the YBE
         by considering the structure of the fusion ring \(O(2n)_2\). In particular,
         first we solve the Pentagon equations to obtain a set of \(F\)-matrices
         for \(O(2n)_2\). Then for each \(X \in O(2n)_2\) we choose a fusion basis
         for \(\text{Hom}(S^{\otimes m}, X)\) and apply an appropriate sequences \(F\)- and \(R\)-moves.

    <td>Schur&ndash;Weyl dualities for quantum affine symmetric pairs</td>
    <td>In the work of Kang, Kashiwara, Kim, and Oh, the Schur-Weyl
        duality between quantum affine algebras and affine Hecke algebras is
        extended to certain Khovanov&ndash;Lauda&ndash;Rouquier (KLR) algebras,
        whose defining combinatorial datum is given by the poles of the normalised
        R–matrix on a set of representations. In this talk, I will review their
        construction  and introduce a ‘’boundary'' analogue, consisting of a
        Schur&ndash;Weyl duality between a quantum symmetric pair of affine type
        and a modified KLR algebras arising from a (framed) quiver with a contravariant
        involution. With respect to the Kang&ndash;Kashiwara&ndash;Kim&ndash;Oh
        construction, the extra combinatorial datum we take into account is given
        by the poles of the normalised K-matrix of the quantum symmetric pair.

    <td>Fused Hecke algebra and quantum Schur&ndash;Weyl duality</td>
    <td>This talk will be about the algebra of fused permutations and the fused
        Hecke algebra. The motivation for considering these algebras is three-fold:
        obtaining finite-dimensional algebras related to the braid group, providing
        solutions of the Yang&ndash;Baxter equation, and generalising the Schur&ndash;Weyl
        duality. The braid-like diagrammatic description of the fused Hecke algebra
        will be presented together with its combinatorial shadow of fused permutations.
        An explicit construction of solutions of the Yang&ndash;Baxter equation
        inside these algebras will be given. Finally, the meaning of these algebras
        in the context of the Schur&ndash;Weyl duality will be explained: they
        provide a description of the centralisers of tensor products of symmetric
        powers representations of quantum groups. The representation theory of the
        fused Hecke algebra will be explained and, from this, the centralisers can
        be constructed as quotients, both with a representation-theoretic and an
        algebraic/diagrammatic description. These constructions can be seen in
        particular as analogues for higher spins of a construction of the
        Temperley&ndash;Lieb algebras from the Hecke algebras.

         and conjectured that it is identified with the Schubert basis of the
         \(K\)-homology of the affine Grassmannian. We prove that the conjecture
         is true by using the theory of non-commutative symmetric functions with
         affine Weyl group symmetry. I also discuss some connections with the
         \(K\)-theoretic Peterson isomorphism. The talk is based on a joint work
         with S. Naito and S. Iwao.</td>

    <td>From Gumbel to Tracy&ndash;Widom via random (ordinary, plane, and cylindric plane) partitions</td>
    <td>We present a few natural (and combinatorial) measures on partitions,
         plane partitions, and cylindric plane partitions. We show how the
         extremal statistics of such measures, i.e. the distributions of the
         largest parts of the respective random objects, interpolate between
         the Gumbel distribution of classical statistics and the Tracy&ndash;Widom
         GUE distribution of random matrix theory, and do so in more than one way.
         These laws usually appear in opposite probabilistic contexts: the
         former distribution (Gumbel) appears universally in the study of
         extrema of iid random variables, the latter (Tracy&ndash;Widom) appears
         in the extrema of correlated systems (e.g. for the largest eigenvalue
         of random Hermitian matrices). All statistics also have a last passage
         percolation interpretation via the Robinson&ndash;Schensted&ndash;Knuth
         correspondence. Proofs rely on an interplay between algebraic
         combinatorics, mathematical physics, and complex analysis. The results
         are based on joint works with Jérémie Bouttier and Alessandra Occelli.</td>

    <td>Quantum Schur dualities and Kazhdan&ndash;Lusztig bases</td>
    <td>The standard quantum Schur duality (due to Jimbo) concerns about
         commuting actions on a tensor space of a quantum group and a Hecke
         algebra of type A. Several years ago, this was generalized to a duality
         between a Hecke algebra of type B and a quasi-split \(i\)-quantum group
         arising from quantum symmetric pairs by Bao and myself (and Watanabe
         in unequal parameters). Both dualities are connected to canonical bases
         and Kazhdan&ndash;Lusztig theory of type ABCD. In this talk, I will
         explain a unification of both dualities involving more general
         \(i\)-quantum groups, which leads to a new generalization of
         Kazhdan&ndash;Lusztig bases. This is joint work with Yaolong Shen.</td>
