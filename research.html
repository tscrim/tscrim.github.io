<main>
<p>
The main part of my research is in the intersection of combinatorics and
representation theory. The motivation for the problems I am inerested in
usually come from mathematical physics, more specifically with integrable
systems and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_group#Drinfeld%E2%80%93Jimbo_type_quantum_groups">
(Drinfel'd&ndash;Jimbo) quantum groups</a>. My research also has
motivations and applications in algebraic geometry.
</p>

<p>
My focus is in <em>crystals</em>, which is a combinatorial realization
of a special basis for a quantum group representation. Crystals encode the
representation through certain edge-colored weighted directed graphs known
as crystal graphs. They also translate many of the algebraic properties of
the representations into combinatorial rules such as tensor products,
dualities, and restrictions. This can also be used to give representation
theoretic interpretations of more classical combinatorial maps. For instance,
in type \(A_n\), crystals are given by semistandard tableaux and maps such as
evacuation, promotion, (co)plactic operations have natural interpretations
using crystals.
</p>

<p>
For more information on crystals (in particular, how you can use them in
<a href="http://www.sagemath.org">SageMath</a>), see the
<a href="http://www.sagemath.org">SageMath</a> thematic tutorial on
<a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/lie.html">
Lie methods and related combinatorics</a>.
A good book for crystals is <i>Crystal bases: Representations and Combinatorics</i>
by Danial Bump and Anne Schilling.
</p>

<p>
One important class of crystals are certain finite crystals for affine type
called <em>Kirillov&ndash;Reshetikhin (KR) crystals</em>, which are the crystal
bases of Kirillov&ndash;Reshetikhin modules. These are no longer highest
weight crystals, and so present unique challenges outside of the general
theory. Despite this, they are known to be connected through their character
theory with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_polynomials">
(nonsymmetric) Macdonald polynomials<a/> specialized at \(t = 0\), Q-systems,
integrable systems, and soliton cellular automata. They are also related
to Demazure subcrystals of affine highest weight crystals. Open problems
include showing the existence of KR crystals for the exceptional affine types,
constructing combinatorial model for the KR crystals, and describing a uniform
model for all KR crystals.
</p>

<p>
One combinatorial model that I have been working on is given by <em>rigged
configurations</em>. Rigged configurations come from mathematical physics,
where they were originally used to index solutions to the Bethe ansatz to
Heisenberg spin chains. The <em>\(X=M\) conjecture</em> of Hatayama <i>et al.</i>
says there is an equality of the weighted generating functions of rigged
configurations and classically highest weight elements in a tensor product
of KR crystals. I have been working on the program to prove the \(X=M\)
conjecture by constructing a particular recursive bijection \(\Phi\).
<a href="http://www.sci.osaka-cu.ac.jp/~okado/index-e.html">Masato Okado</a>,
<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/">Anne Schilling</a> and I have
shown this in all nonexceptional affine types, and I am currently working on
proving such a bijection in the exceptional affine types. The bijection \(\Phi\)
can also be considered as a linearization of the dynamics of solution cellular
automata, a generalization of the Takahashi&ndash;Satsuma box-ball system,
which have natural interpretations using rigged configurations.
</p>

<p>
From \(\Phi\), we can translate the natural (classical) crystal structure
from the Kirillov&ndash;Reshetikhin crystals to rigged configurations. This
was first done for highest weight crystals \(B(\lambda)\) in simply-laced types
by Anne Schilling in 2006. <a href="http://people.cst.cmich.edu/salis1bt/">Ben Salisbury</a>
and I then extended this to all (symmetrizable) types,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Kac%E2%80%93Moody_algebra">
Borcherds (or generalized Kac&ndash;Moody Lie) algebras</a>, and to the
crystal \(B(\infty)\). It appears that rigged configurations are a natural
crystal model as the \(*\)-involution corresponds to the natural involution
of replacing riggings with coriggings.
</p>

<p>
One of my major research projects is constructing an analog of this theory
for the affine Lie superalgebras.
</p>

<p>
Another major research project has been developing a K-theory extension of type
\(A_n\) crystals. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_polynomial">Schur
functions</a> are polynomial representatives of Schubert classes in the
cohomology ring of the Grassmannian, the set of \(k\)-dimensional planes in
\(\mathbb{C}^n\). If we instead consider the K-theory of the Grassmannian,
polynomial representatives are the <em>symmetric Grothendieck polynomials</em>.
Symmetric Grothendieck polynomials are the generating functions of
<em>set-valued tableaux</em>, a semistandard tableau where entries can be
nonempty sets of positive integers. Cara Monical,
<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pechenik/">Oliver Pechenik</a>, and I
constructed a type \(A_n\) crystal structure on set-valued tableaux, and using
the divided difference operator definition, proposed a new structure that will
categorify symmetric Grothendieck polynomials that we call a <em>K-crystal</em>.
We have currently shown this structure exists for all rectangular shapes.
Recently, I have been using colored integrable lattice models to prove various
combinatorial properties of (symmetric) Grothendieck polynomials.
