<p>
I am currently a JSPS Standard Postdoc located at
<a href="http://www.sci.osaka-cu.ac.jp/OCAMI/index_e.html">OCAMI</a> within
<a href="https://www.osaka-cu.ac.jp/en">Osaka City University</a>
and hosted by
<a href="http://www.sci.osaka-cu.ac.jp/~okado/index-e.html">Masato Okado</a>.
I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from
<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a> in 2015
under the guidance of <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/">Anne Schilling</a>.
From 2015 to 2017, I was an RTG Postdoctoral Associate as part of the
combinatorics group at the <a href="http://www.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota</a>,
specifically under the mentorship of
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pylyavskyy/">Pavlo Pylyavskyy</a>.
From 2017 to 2019, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at 
<a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">The University of Queensland</a> under the
mentorship of <a href="https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/OleWarnaar/">Ole Warnaar</a>.

From 2019 to 2021, I was a lecturer at

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>
My primary research interests are in combinatorics and representation theory,
specifically in the area of crystals and (Kac&ndash;Moody) Lie algebras.
My research focuses on a specific class of finite crystals for affine Lie
algebras called <em>Kirillov&ndash;Reshetikhin (KR) crystals</em> and
combinatorial objects called rigged configurations.
The (conjectural) bijection between tensor products of KR crystals and
rigged configurations of objects arose from statistical mechanics and has
led to applications in soliton cellular automata, a generalization of the
box-ball system. In particular, this would give a (combinatorial) proof of
the \(X = M\) conjecture. Characters of tensor products of KR crystals also
have deep connections with other areas of mathematics, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_polynomials">(non)symmetric Macdonald polynomials<a/>
and Q-systems. <a href="http://people.cst.cmich.edu/salis1bt/">Ben Salisbury</a>
and I have also generalized rigged configurations to be a model for highest
weight crystals, where they appear to be a very natural model.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, I am interested in generalizations of crystals; specifically
in geometric crystals, a rational lifting of crystals, and crystals for
Lie superalgebras and Borcherds algebras. Recently I have been working on
developing a theory of crystals related to the K-theory of the Grassmannian
and Schubert calculus and with stochastic processes. I have additional
interests in combinatorial Hopf algebras, which includes symmetric functions,
Coxeter and Artin groups, and Hecke algebras.
