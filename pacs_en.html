<h2>About the seminar</h2>

<!-- <img src="math.jpg" alt="Some math picture" style="padding-left:20px;float:right;width:450px;height:300px;"> -->

<p>
Many interesting phenomena in physics can be described by algebriac objects
that have combinatorial interpretations. Some of these include quantum groups
and crystal bases, quiver varieties, and solvable lattice models.
This seminar series focuses on studying these interactions.
</p>

<p>
We meet fortnightly on Fridays at 10 AM (Japan Standard Time).
All of our talks will be broadcast via Zoom with a hybrid setting at OCAMI
when possible.

    <td>Schurian-infinite blocks of type \(A\) Hecke algebras</td>
    <td>For any algebra \(A\) over an algebraically closed field \(\mathbb{F}\),
         we say that an \(A\)-module \(M\) is Schurian if \(\mathrm{End}_A(M) \cong \mathbb{F}\).
         We say that \(A\) is Schurian-finite if there are only finitely many
         isomorphism classes of Schurian \(A\)-modules, and Schurian-infinite
         otherwise. I will present recent joint work with Susumu Ariki in which
         we determined that many blocks of type \(A\) Hecke algebras are
         Schurian-infinite. A wide variety of techniques were employed in this
         project &mdash; I will give more details on those required for our
         results concerning the principal blocks.</td>

    <td>2D CFT characters from 4D \(U(N)\) instanton counting on \(\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n\)</td>
    <td>As a type of the Alday&ndash;Gaiotto&ndash;Tachikawa correspondence, 
         we explicitly show how the \(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)_N\) characters and 
         the \(n\)-th parafermion \(\mathcal{W}_N\) characters are obtained from 
         4D \(U(N)\) instanton counting on \(\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n\) with
         \(\Omega\)-deformation.  This is based on

    <td>Braid group symmetries on i-quantum groups</td>
    <td>Introduced by Lusztig in the early 1990s, the braid group symmetries
         constitute an essential part in the theory of quantum groups. The
         i-quantum groups are coideal subalgebras of quantum groups arising
         from quantum symmetric pairs, which can be viewed as natural
         generalizations of quantum groups. In this talk, I will present our
         construction of relative braid group symmetries (associated to the
         relative Weyl group of a symmetric pair) on i-quantum groups of
         arbitrary finite types. These new symmetries inherit most properties
         of Lusztig's symmetries, including compatible relative braid group
         actions on modules. This is joint work with Weiqiang Wang.</td>

    <td>Combinatorial description of the K-homology Schubert classes of the affine Grassmannian</td>
    <td>Lam, Schilling, and Shimozono constructed a family of inhomogeneous
         symmetric functions that is identified with a distinguished basis of
         \(K\)-homology of the affine Grassmannian of \(SL_{k+1}\). These
         functions are called the \(K\)-theoretic \(k\)-Schur functions and are
         indexed by the partitions whose largest part is less than or equal
         to \(k\). Recently, Blasiak, Morse, and Seelinger proved a raising
         operator formula for the \(K\)-\(k\)-Schur functions. In fact, they
         introduced a family of inhomogeneous symmetric functions called
         the \(K\)-theoretic Catalan functions, Katalan functions for short,
         and proved that the \(K\)-theoretic \(k\)-Schur functions are a
         subfamily of Katalan functions. Then also introduced a subfamily of
         Katalan functions called \(K\)-\(k\)-Schur "closed" Katalan functions,
         and conjectured that it is identified with the Schubert basis of the
         \(K\)-homology of the affine Grassmannian. We prove that the conjecture
         is true by using the theory of non-commutative symmetric functions with
         affine Weyl group symmetry. I also discuss some connections with the
         \(K\)-theoretic Peterson isomorphism. The talk is based on a joint work
         with S. Naito and S. Iwao.</td>

    <td>From Gumbel to Tracy&ndash;Widom via random (ordinary, plane, and cylindric plane) partitions</td>
    <td>We present a few natural (and combinatorial) measures on partitions,
         plane partitions, and cylindric plane partitions. We show how the
         extremal statistics of such measures, i.e. the distributions of the
         largest parts of the respective random objects, interpolate between
         the Gumbel distribution of classical statistics and the Tracy&ndash;Widom
         GUE distribution of random matrix theory, and do so in more than one way.
         These laws usually appear in opposite probabilistic contexts: the
         former distribution (Gumbel) appears universally in the study of
         extrema of iid random variables, the latter (Tracy&ndash;Widom) appears
         in the extrema of correlated systems (e.g. for the largest eigenvalue
         of random Hermitian matrices). All statistics also have a last passage
         percolation interpretation via the Robinson&ndash;Schensted&ndash;Knuth
         correspondence. Proofs rely on an interplay between algebraic
         combinatorics, mathematical physics, and complex analysis. The results
         are based on joint works with Jérémie Bouttier and Alessandra Occelli.</td>

    <td>Quantum Schur dualities and Kazhdan&ndash;Lusztig bases</td>
    <td>The standard quantum Schur duality (due to Jimbo) concerns about
         commuting actions on a tensor space of a quantum group and a Hecke
         algebra of type A. Several years ago, this was generalized to a duality
         between a Hecke algebra of type B and a quasi-split \(i\)-quantum group
         arising from quantum symmetric pairs by Bao and myself (and Watanabe
         in unequal parameters). Both dualities are connected to canonical bases
         and Kazhdan&ndash;Lusztig theory of type ABCD. In this talk, I will
         explain a unification of both dualities involving more general
         \(i\)-quantum groups, which leads to a new generalization of
         Kazhdan&ndash;Lusztig bases. This is joint work with Yaolong Shen.</td>
